I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...
And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return.
Wage war like no tomorrow
Cuz no hell there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome
Trips to where, few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow,
Of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below
The bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves, of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order
Elitist horde of
Creeping fire
Seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm
Time is gone
Moonlight drawn
Fly til dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm
Of the coming storm
In blood sworn
To glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship... 
I am the beast I worship
In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse
The spiral storm
Of flames inside
The torch I raise
The force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches blood
Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitches leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise
Into apocalyptic skies
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with not to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns, within my gut
As my bones turn into dust
And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow, know well there wont we one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome ...
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...
I am the beast I worship
Pass that shit
Hold on man park the car
I have no idea where we are
Think we may have drove too far
Yeah I can see they're right behind us
But there's nothing we can do
We can't get caught slipping get off that shit and just be cool ... ooooh
They're on to us but don't look now
They think they're bout to take us down
Fuck that I'm not going out
At the next corner turn left
Its time to handle this
I know where to go don't trip
Have no time for that pussy shit
In a minute it'll all be finished
What you don't think I speak the truth
You think I could just be sitting here
Listening to Sonic Youth?
Anyway when they try to ride
On you thinking I'm gone
I'll creep up on them from behind
And break them off one by one
And in the time it takes you to blink your eyes
Shit'll already be done
But just in case anything goes wrong
Keep your right hand on your ... oohh
So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine .. oohh
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin while you're sleepin
Steady creepin, blood creepin
Shake the bottle, whats it hold
How many have I already sold
Hope not too much, cuz I feel insane
Need more than one to numb the pain
Slithering through my brain
Thoughts stuck on that train
Off the track and up in flames
Fuck it I'll swallow these blue ones
Yeah and maybe this big one
And I may as well take a few more with me
Just in case I get some ... oohh
Never know if they're gonna want some
Oh you want one? Yeah no problem
Got that covered tramp, I brought 'em ... oooh
How it creeps up on me so slowly
I don't notice my eyes rolling
To the back of my head and falling
Shit, somebody's calling
Can't answer the phone
Call them back when I'm 'bout to leave
Can't think straight man I'm so fucking blown... ooohh
So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine .. oohh
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin while you're sleepin
Steady creepin, blood creepin
Down the alleys in the middle of the night
I'm trashed, so high its hard to ride my bike
Might crash, whenever I'm this fucked up
Drunken monkey through the cuts
Who gives a fuck
So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine .. oohh
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin while you're sleepin
Steady creepin, blood creepinCulture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull
You know whats going on every day every night
Everywhere swear you're so international
Upside down cross on the Jumbotron
Wait up, hold on
Blowing anthrax off my palms
Say what, you're wrong
Switch stance, face plant
Napalm fire starters
Flatlander, plug puller
Nose dive turbulence chartered
You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow
You're the media's creation, yeah your free will has been taken and you don't know
Choke yourself, fuck yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Never seen without one hundred
She's a satanic priestess
Anarchy on ice freak flag flying faceless elitist
Crow on the down low end
Reppin' Orion's belt
Atlantis ancient vagina
Getting dusty on the shelf
Enter the pigs don't get it
No hands I'm shattering jaws
Double nickles on the dime
Fuck glam can lick my balls
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Whatchya gonna be when you're grown young blood?
Gonna be a mindless drone
Won't ever have to think
No your head'll be linked directly to your cell phone
The virus is alive, I can see it in your eyes
The infection is full blown
Career killer, double decker packed with suicidal brides
Four armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches thighs
Enters through unknowing eyes
Touch the key its in your mind
Can't delete it and soon you'll find
How bad you need it all the time
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Shiva slashin through your flat screen
Is nowhere for you to hide
Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons
Vampire on the rise
Punk a chump wit a cunt for brains platoon
In the zone and on the grind
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks
Catch and release
Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Gotta get them outta here now
Infected act so weird how'd you get it
You're pathetic
Quarantine the virus

And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yah
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine - yah
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech,
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call
Out out out out - yah
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets
Out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to
far more than all that's ever been said - yah
Tie the chord kick the chair and your dead - yah
Yah ... guillotine - yah ... guillotine - yah
Head of a trick in a bucket
Body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it

Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yah
Choke on these nuts til the very last - yah

Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixin rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel
The passion that blinds me so I feel - YAH

Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yahBeen working way too much need to get out and get fucked up
Whats going on, where's it at
Make some calls to make it crack, lets see...
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So 'til dawn we're okay... but anyway..
Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a godd buzz going
Cuz everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And shes looking so you're knowing
You could get it tonight
But there's so much around
Best take your time do it right
As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that's left of you
Is your most primal desires
Ass clappin, dick suckin, lock the door to the bathroom ?quick fuckin
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin, cuz you're drunk and you'll be blackin out
Before you even get a chance to think bout what you're doing
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch..
Bitch
Getting looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin
You're cruisin, you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a
Cuz you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding cuz your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, its time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, til its finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor til it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me I'm all bout the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song
You know the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Til they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as its done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy's hella horny
And their pussies don't smell
Argh... where's it at
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch..
Bitch
Responsibility's cool, but there's more things in life
Like getting your dick
Rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more cuz you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
Its time to find one and take one
Right now
Its time to find one and make one say
I'm down
Think I just found one, bout to break one off
Meanwhile...
Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles,
May have gotten too fucked up cuz I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but its worth a try
First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do lets hope my story isn't all about haters
Wheres it at, cuz I want it like man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me cuz I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Wheres it at?
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yea, what'd I say bitch..

Cuz when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip
Minding my own business...

How they set me up should I test my luck, here they come they're in pursuit
What did I do? What haven't I done, you want to see my I.D. Umm...
Well ok, where I'm coming from?
Just on my way not on the run

All they ever do is trip
Six feet deep below the street
So they can't never say shit again
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick
And put a black flag on the end
Got to watch my back or just like that
I'm bound to get locked up
The law's watching me, constantly
Too close and way too much
Looking over my shoulder and checking in the rear view mirror
Cuz I'm never not but a moment from getting taken to jail
They're knocking at my door, down my door
They're shining lights in my eyes
Exactly what do they stand for
Ever asking more of I man why
Like it matters why I chose to ignore
All the laws I've been told to abide
Think I'm on parole, thinking I just stole
Some shit you got an A.P.B out on but no
You're wrong as usual hell no it wasn't me
Have the nerve to ask me if I'm drunk when I'm pissing in the middle of the street
Looking over my shoulder...
By the way why they always acting
Like they know how to size me up
Ignorant bastards coming after me
All the time on mine had enough.
Why they always wanna hassle me, pigs all up on my nuts
Like they have to be, like I can't see em
Trying to play shade tree in the cuts
By robbing me of my dignity
So in the end I never say much
But ain't a time pass I don't wish I could flash
On penelope like fuck!
Shot this for everyone who's been there
For my real ones who understand
What it feels like to have your rights read to you by the ...Known for it.. known for it
Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, til I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout ta crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had ta do it
Hacked into it
I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it.. Known for it
Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this
You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it,
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds
Keep em guessin endlessly
Never let em know where your headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How ta show em they don't mean shit ta me
Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or it'll take everything you own, floor it
Get it, get it
I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it.. Known for it
Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this
Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How ta ride it inside out of da clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don't doubt it
You might just need it
Already did that,
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don't trip
If ya have one let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it
Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it ta wind, round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cuz I will be damned if mine ever decays
Forever on attack gut check the blind
Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life
Cuz I.. am.. known for itInto the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing
fuck that I'm the lord of the game
I rule this empire
Lord of the game
Born to reign above all
that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train
Of thought we drop like
neutron bombs from the tower
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver
Whippin the wheel
Flippin donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base, where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel
It so much my gut burns like the tires
Movin this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done
For the real ones packin real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come
Fuckin cowards
When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low
Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
'Pon which we maintain
Like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
Wars never done, think it is you die
Where was I now
Like I said before
Hear someone knockin
At my front door
Who could it be, should I ignore
The knockin or see what could be in store
For me if I leave the safety of the shore
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia, is it real?
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel
When they ask if you can make it
And you don't wanna go
When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low
(Rather be stuck naked)
Than waste my time like the last time
And every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time
When you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you
Said you'd never go back.
Fuck where you're from,
Fuck where you're goin,
It's all about where you're atI fuck the music
I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Wanna beer, have no fear, comes and goes, man its here
No one knows, feels so weird, when it blows through my bones
I got a jones for it
I wanna know more, cuz its bout what I got to show for it
I want some more of it
I want too much
I got so bored with it
I shot it up
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up
What is it, where is it
How will it affect me
Fuck that shit, I need that shits bound to be the death of me
Fuck buying it I'm taking it, and sharing it with nobody
Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job
I own that shit
On some throw back shit
You already know that shit
You even know 'bout how I know the man
Who grows that, bitch o
You can't buy it with your money
You can't find it overseas
Its one of those things that seems outlandish
Til you have it's not a dream
As for me, I'm cool with it
And that's alright cuz it's my thing.
Work that angle til its beveled
Curve of the blade doubled
Edge made to bleed the struggle
Best believe the game's a hustle.
Observer of the strange occurrences
Conjurer of the subtle
Unseen but felt disturbances
That burst a bitches bubble
That's right it's all mine
It's all mine never was yours
Like how you wait in line
While I walk straight through the door
(straight through the...)
Hear you say something
But ain't nothing ?spectators ignored
Pay no mind to that chump's
Just a player hatin whore
I fuck the music
I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Ain't no fun if the aliens can't have none
How I fuck it dirty
How I make it twitch and scream
How it screams oh baby hurt me
Work me to the bone oh please
How I bend the rhythm over
And hit, hit, hit it on my knees
Give, give, give it up
I need it all the time
Bleed it on the drop of a dime ?down to pound it til it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine
Make no mistake, I makes it mine
Break shit down and make it grind
To the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds
Through secrets behind and between
Every time I scream
Shit is mine
Its all mine
All the time
Shit is mine
What is it, where is it, how will it affect me
Fuck that shit I need that shit
Thought you knew, thought you thought
Thought you did but did not
Come on through what you got
Is it cool is it hot?
Check one two, man don't stop
I'm not through black blood clot
In my view like that twat
Spread eagle cross the block
Need no ego to rock
What we know just gets dropped
How we keep shit on lock
Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mod
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job
Shit is mine
Its all mine
All the time
Shit is mineTriple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight, what its like to experience - Takyon
Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like fuck what was that
Man I don't know, but it made me feel so heated
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
Cuz even if you did, you'd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it til it bleeds to death, each track
Like EPMD snappin necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon
Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't cuz its way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain't never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10-9-8-7-triple 6-5-forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain't a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war
Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon
Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here's the deal, if you don't feel ill
Don't want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned
Takyon - bitch slappin pussy clots and clones
Takyon - settin off unibombs inside your dome
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - TakyonI'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore
What this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes
Through your bitch ass decor
Split it back like a whore
And make you shit your fucking drawers
Scared to ride, cowards fall
Before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons
Drug by demons down your halls
Can't imagine whats fit to happen
When I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what their lacking
And less than that in no time at all.
Can't believe they have the gaul
To try and act like they're not trapped
Between these walls ...
Bring it, bring it, bring it, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it
Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there
NEVER GET THERE
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here?
WANNA LEAVE HERE
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls?
THROUGH THE WALLS
And if I can, were they even ever there at all?
NOT AT ALL
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don't give a damn
Twist a gram and keep on sticking with the original plan
Fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged
Even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of
Don't know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because
I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much
There you go
How it is now's how it it always was
That's on my blood
How it is now's how it it always was
That's on my blood
Bring it, bring that shit heated
Sling it, bring back that shit - kill it
See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, cuz I can't just slip into a zagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black
As the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack
The part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact
That we've forgotten how to sweat it
Check it
Bring it
KILL IT
On everything I own
Swear would rather slit my throat and die on the run
Than be the one who ends up hangin from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game
Before I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame
All the way insane
Staring at the ceiling
In the dark
Trying not to let the feeling
Tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing
And it won't stop
Tell yourself its almost over
But its not

it's all suicide to me 
world of dogs 
its all suicide 
you live in hiding 
you're climbing the walls no privacy 
I'm trying to survive but I'm dying die with me 
blow out the lights take your life 
ride the falling sky with me 
falling inside of me 
its all suicide to me 
world of dogs 
its all suicide 
world of dogs gone mad 
above the law in your ass 
fire trash meltdown I'm not here 
I'm world of dogs infrared 
tear me apart left for dead 
but I'm not dead yet 
sickem sickem yes 
world of dogs 
ruthless and free 
its all suicide to me 
cut it 
don't tell no one no one can know come closer 
I'm almost over lower sinkholer 
I'm nothing feed me to this world of dogs 
barely breathing in this world of dogs 
foam of feral reality forming on mountains of teeth 
devour the hand spit out the leash 
crown the beast my thrones the street 
too cold to sleep I kill myself I feel no pain 
I'm obsolete 
world of dogs
